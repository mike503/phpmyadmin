I'm keeping this copy of phpMyAdmin 2.34.2.5 online and tweaking it for modern PHP use as I go along.

The newer phpMyAdmin versions act a bit weird and bother me. I don't need all the bells and whistles.

I've added some sensible defaults, hacked some broken "older" SQL, and otherwise just keep this limping along.
